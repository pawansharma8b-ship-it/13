I have been sitting here thinking about us replaying every single moment we stole together like they are the only things keeping me steady right now. Do you remember the first time we met? Those 45 minutes felt like forever and nothing at all. I was shaking so hard just looking at you my heart was hammering like it wanted to jump out and run to you. Then you pulled that little hand-measuring trick… I still feel the way your fingers slid between mine. We laughed until our stomachs hurt, and in that second I knew I was done for.
Our second date at the zoo ohh God! that day, You called my name from the deepest part of your heart, grabbed my arm, and those slow leaves were falling around us like the world was giving us its own private space. We were staring at nothing, but I could see everything you and me, right there perfectly framed. And then the museum I was supposed to be looking at the painting, but how could I when you were standing next to me? Your eyes have more colors than any canvas ever could. I could not look away. You are the real masterpiece.
I still smile thinking about you taking that ashirvaad from that Mummy. When are you planning to come take one from my mummy ? I am waiting, you know. And I am still sorry about that sandwich you ordered me to finsh it should hveve eaten it, I should have done everything you said (jyada feel me mat aana its just valentine i will still do what my heart says and you know what it says ?? AVIKAAAAAAAAH! AVVIKAAAAH! MOVE AWAY LET ME SEE JIJA ! GULABI DIL ). You have always been my mentor, my guide. I look up to you so much. Remember when I said I wont be average, Avu? I meant it. You make me want to be better, every single day.
The third time we met… I, the mighty Abhi, booked the whole theater just for you. We ate those messy burgers in the auto, laughing like kids. I wiped that ketchup from the corner of your lips and… well, you know what happened next. I kissed someone who looked exactly like you in that auto, and it felt like the luckiest moment of my life.
Even the fights make me smile now. That time you were choking me, holding my neck so tight I could barely breathe, and your friends were cracking up Jasmeet, who never smiles around me, was laughing her teeth out that night. I deserved it, and somehow it still felt like love.
The library day when you were so annoyed and embarrassed because of me I learned my lesson. I stopped being so loud and frank with everyone after that. But with you, with the people I amm truly comfortable with I still laugh and play .
 I really love you, and I dont even know why sometimes it just is. Deep and stupid If I stay quiet for a while, if life makes me love you a little softer and lesser, will you still love me the same? Or will you love me more when I am quiet? I dont know and those moments under the tree… on that trek… you know exactly what I mean .. i still dont now how to add emojis here but here's a smirck . I am not writing them here because I know you will not read this alone,
I miss you more than words can carry. This distance sucks, but every memory I have written here keeps you close. You are still my something and i think i raised your standard again dont worry i am not spoiling you gudiya mein hoon na !!
Come back to me soon, okay?
 yours Coorporate senior helper ,
